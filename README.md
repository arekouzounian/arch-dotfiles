# Arch Linux Dotfiles 

This is a repo to store and track all the various dotfiles I create while learning Arch Linux. 

Currently, the setup is as follows:
- [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org) for the display management with uwsm
- [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org) & [Starship](https://starship.rs) for terminal emulation and styling 
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io) for development (because I might as well learn vim if I'm already doing Arch)
